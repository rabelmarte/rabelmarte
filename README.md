### Hey there, my name's Rabel ðŸ‘‹

<div>
  I am a computer scientist and software engineer who is interested in cryptography, privacy, and finance. I currently work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.betterment.com/" target="_blank">Betterment</a>, based in New York City. Formerly I was a student at the University of Kansas where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

  While at the University of Kansas, I helped start <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sparkatku/" target='_blank'>Spark</a>, an organization dedicated to inspiring, educating, and exposing K-12 students to the wonders of technology.

  A child, a teen, a college student, a grad student, and an expert, if I can successfully explain computer science concepts to any of these five levels, then I've truly mastered the field of computer science. This concept is inspired by my favorite <a href="https://www.wired.com/video/watch/5-levels-hacker-explains-one-concept-in-5-levels-of-difficulty?c=series" target='_blank'>Wired series</a> called <i>5 Levels</i>, where a person does just this. Using my skillsets, I will be applying this same idea, as I explore different topics of interest here.
